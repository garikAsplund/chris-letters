Finally, please switch off any software that might shift the colors of your display (like "Night Shift" in OS X).

    We humbly ask that you complete the study in a single sitting, so please do your best to stay focused and attentive throughout. Once you begin, please do not use your browser's "Back" button or "Refresh" buttons throughout the study, as this may cause errors, or force you to redo certain sections of the study.
