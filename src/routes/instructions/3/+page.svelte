<p>For each trial, you will see a rapid stream of gray letters inside a gray box. Your task, for every stream, is to detect the designated target letter, which will be the only red letter.
 
    After you finish viewing each stream, you will be prompted to type in the target letter you saw. Once you input the letter, you will automatically be taken to the next trial. Both capital and lowercase letters will be accepted.
     
    If you do not know what the target letter is, you may just input your best guess.
