<p>Before you begin the real trials, let's practice the task eight times for you to get acquainted with the procedure. For the first four trials, you will be asked to practice the task with slower speed. For the next four trials, you will be asked to practice the task with normal speed. During the practice trials, feedback (i.e., correct or wrong) will be given after answering each question.
